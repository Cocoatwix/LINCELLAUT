The makefile included with LINCELLAUT is used primarily to build lincellaut.c, along with its required object files if needed. makeshare.ps1 is used to create orbitvis.so, the shared library used for ORBITVIS, along with the other object files. If you aren't using ORBITVIS, you can safely ignore makeshare.ps1.

The reason for creating a separate makefile-like file for creating orbitvis.so is due to environment constraints. LINCELLAUT is primarily developed on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (running via Windows Subsystem for Linux), while ORBITVIS is primarily developed on Windows 10 (build 19043.1645) due to needing a GUI to run PyGame. Because of this, object files used for ORBITVIS development need to be built on Windows, while object files for LINCELLAUT need to be built on Ubuntu. Thus, it's easier to use a .ps1 script for building on Windows and a makefile for building on Ubuntu.

Eventually, the makefile will also have a target for making the ORBITVIS files. The Powershell script may or may not be updated to make the LINCELLAUT files.
