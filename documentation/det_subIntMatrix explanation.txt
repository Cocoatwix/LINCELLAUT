The function det_subIntMatrixT stores a submatrix. The submatrix is specified by x and y, the indices in the matrix where the matrix is sliced.

For instance, consider the matrix:
1 2 3
3 2 1
2 2 2

Specifying (x, y) as (0, 0) will slice the matrix along row 0 and column 0:
x x x
x 2 1
x 2 2

So calling the function with the above matrix and setting (x, y) as (0, 0) will return a pointer to the matrix
2 1
2 2

Similarly, specifying (x, y) as (2, 1) will return a pointer to the matrix
1 3
3 1

If (x, y) is specified to be outside the valid indices of the given matrix, the function will return 0.

Note that memory for these new matrices will be alloted everytime the function is called, so freeing that memory is the programmer's responsibility.
