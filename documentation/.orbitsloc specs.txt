.orbitsloc files (short for .orbits locations) are files created alongside .orbits files to help users find orbits for specific vectors. Currently, .orbitsloc files are only created for 2 by 2 matrix systems, though this is subject to change in the future.

A .orbitsloc file is merely an array of integers, each one representing the line number of where a vector's orbit starts in the corresponding .orbits file. Each integer is separated by a space. An example .orbitsloc file for a 2 by 2 matrix system with modulus 3 could be:

0 2 5
7 11 15
17 19 22

As an example, let's find the orbit of the vector <1, 2> in the .orbits file. The line number of where that vector's orbit starts is given by the number in row #1 and column #2 (row and column numbers start with #0). In the example above, that number is 15. So, we simply navigate to line 15 in the .orbits file to see the orbit for <1, 2>. 

Note that most text editors label the first line in a file as line 1, while the .orbitsloc file lists the first line as line 0. This means that, if manually browsing through a .orbits file, a user will most likely add one to each line number in the .orbitsloc file to find their intended orbits.
