.iteration files contain the resulting vectors of each vector under some modulus multiplied by some update matrix. Unlike .orbits files, .iteration files only store one vector per initial vector and store results in a predicatable order. This bypasses the need for a separate location file and keeps the resulting file size small.

The format of a .iteration file is very similar to a .orbit file. Each line contains one row vector whose entries are separated by spaces. No separators are used in .iteration files. An example .iteration file is listed below:

0 0
0 2
0 1
2 0
2 2
2 1
1 0
1 2
1 1

This .iteration file was created for a system mod 3. To find how <1, 2> gets iterated, for example, we go to line 3*1 + 2 = 5 (the first line number is line #0), which gives the vector <2, 1>. In general, to find the iterated version of a vector <a, b, ... , y, z>, we go to line z + mod*y + (mod^2)*x + ... + (mod^(n-2))*b + (mod^(n-1))*a for vectors under the modulus mod and with length n.

It is possible to condense the size of .iteration files if the given system has transient regions, meaning multiple vectors iterate to the same vector. In these cases, the resulting vector needs only to be listed once, while a separate location file can tell the user which lines correspond to which initial vectors. This method is not used by LINCELLAUT as its effectiveness is only apparent when a substantial number of vectors iterate to the same vector and the size of the vectors is large.
