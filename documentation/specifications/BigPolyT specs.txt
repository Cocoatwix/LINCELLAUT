BigPolyT is a structure for representing univariate polynomials. It contains a list of BigIntTs representing the coefficients of the polynomial. They're ordered from smallest to largest term. So, the 0th BigIntT in the list represents the polynomial's constant term, the 1st term represents the coefficient on the linear term, and so on. In other words, the index number of the BigIntT represents the power of the variable it's attached to.

If, say, there's no quadratic term in the polynomial, then the BigIntT in the list representing the quadratic term should be set to zero. Since BigPolyTs determine the coefficients on terms based on the BigIntTs placement in the list, it's necessary to store zeros in indices corresponding to unused terms to tell the structure that they're not used.

BigPolyTs also store the number of terms in the polynomial as an integer.
